# exo: MYOB Exo Business report export tool - work in progress

## What is it?
**exo** is a Python package that utilises MYOB Exo clairty report tool to export reports and data. 
For users who don't have or don't want to have access to exo database, this package uses an indirect
method of excuting exo's own clarity.exe reporting tool to export report and save it to csv file.
 
## Notice
This package has ONLY been tested in MYOB Exo Business 2018.x version as this is the only version that I have access to.
